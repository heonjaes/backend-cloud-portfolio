# AWS Cloud Resume Challenge - Backend with Terraform

![Alt text](<images/infra_diagram.png>)

## Project Description

The AWS Cloud Resume Challenge with Terraform showcases expertise in infrastructure as code (IAC), AWS cloud services, and Terraform. This challenge involves building an automated cloud-native resume website hosted on AWS, featuring dynamic elements such as visitor tracking and integration with various AWS services.

### Key Features

- **Static Website Hosting**: Utilizes Amazon S3 for static content storage, ensuring scalability and high availability.

- **Content Delivery**: Leverages Amazon CloudFront as a content delivery network (CDN) to offer globally low-latency, high-performance website access.

- **Serverless Visitor Counter**: Implements a serverless visitor counter through AWS Lambda and DynamoDB, tracking and displaying website visitor counts.

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Manages AWS resources efficiently with Terraform, enabling infrastructure definition and versioning as code.

- **Secure Access**: Enforces secure AWS access and permissions through IAM (Identity and Access Management) roles and policies.

- **CI/CD Integration**: Establishes CI/CD pipelines, automating deployments and updates using tools like GitHub Actions or AWS CodePipeline.

- **Custom Domain**: Configures Amazon Route 53 to associate a custom domain name (e.g., resume.yourname.com) with your CloudFront distribution.

- **Documentation**: Maintains comprehensive and organized documentation for project clarity and collaboration.

## Prerequisites

Prior to initiating the project, ensure these prerequisites are met:

- **AWS Account with Appropriate Permissions**: Set up an AWS account with necessary permissions for resource management.

- **Terraform Installation**: Install Terraform on your local machine for defining and provisioning AWS infrastructure.

- **AWS Services Knowledge**: Understand AWS services such as Amazon S3, Amazon CloudFront, AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, Amazon Route 53, and AWS IAM.

- **Git for Version Control**: Use Git for version control and project collaboration.

- **GitHub Account**: Have a GitHub account for hosting your project's repository.

- **Code Editor or IDE**: Use a code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) for code writing and editing.

- **IAC Understanding**: Grasp the concept of Infrastructure as Code (IAC) for Terraform usage.
